## spinlock
```c
struct spinlock {
  uint locked;       // Is the lock held?

  // For debugging:
  char *name;        // Name of lock.
  struct cpu *cpu;   // The cpu holding the lock.
  uint pcs[10];      // The call stack (an array of program counters)
                     // that locked the lock.
};
```

## initlock
```
void
initlock(struct spinlock *lk, char *name)
{
  lk->name = name;
  lk->locked = 0;
  lk->cpu = 0;
}
```
## acquire
```c
void acquire(struct spinlock *lk)
{
  pushcli(); // disable interrupts to avoid deadlock.
  if(holding(lk))
    panic("acquire");

  // The xchg is atomic.
  // It also serializes, so that reads after acquire are not
  // reordered before it. 
  while(xchg(&lk->locked, 1) != 0)
    ;

  // Record info about lock acquisition for debugging.
  lk->cpu = cpu;
  getcallerpcs(&lk, lk->pcs);
}
```
## release
```c
void
release(struct spinlock *lk)
{
  if(!holding(lk))
    panic("release");

  lk->pcs[0] = 0;
  lk->cpu = 0;

  // The xchg serializes, so that reads before release are 
  // not reordered after it.  The 1996 PentiumPro manual (Volume 3,
  // 7.2) says reads can be carried out speculatively and in
  // any order, which implies we need to serialize here.
  // But the 2007 Intel 64 Architecture Memory Ordering White
  // Paper says that Intel 64 and IA-32 will not move a load
  // after a store. So lock->locked = 0 would work here.
  // The xchg being asm volatile ensures gcc emits it after
  // the above assignments (and after the critical section).
  xchg(&lk->locked, 0);

  popcli();
}
